# Lego Skittle Sorter Robot Project

## Overview

Welcome to the README for our Lego Skittle Sorter Robot Project! In this project, we used Lego Technic to build a fun and innovative machine that sorts Skittles candies. Our goal was to create a system that could separate the "bad" Skittles and place the good ones into a bowl. We accomplished this by designing a claw machine and a rolling belt, along with the use of color and sensor parts to automate the sorting process.

## 1. Project Description

Our Lego Skittle Sorter Robot is a fascinating combination of mechanical engineering and automation. The robot is designed to sort Skittles candies based on color. It consists of two main components:

- **Claw Machine**: The claw machine is responsible for picking up Skittles one at a time from the initial pile.

- **Rolling Belt**: Once a Skittle is grabbed by the claw, it is placed on a rolling belt. The belt carries the Skittle to a position where color and sensor components are used to determine whether it's a "good" or "bad" Skittle.

The "good" Skittles are directed into a collection bowl, while the "bad" ones are discarded.

## 2. Components Used

To build this Lego Skittle Sorter Robot, we used a variety of Lego Technic parts and some additional components, including:

- Lego Technic pieces (beams, gears, axles, connectors)
- Color sensors
- Touch sensors
- Motors
- EV3 programmable brick
- Skittles candies

## 3. Building Instructions

Building the Skittle Sorter Robot involves several steps and the assembly of the claw machine and rolling belt.

## 4. Operating Instructions

To operate the Lego Skittle Sorter Robot:

1. Load a pile of Skittles into the initial container.
2. Turn on the EV3 programmable brick.
3. Start the robot program.
4. Watch as the robot picks up Skittles and sorts them into the bowl based on their color.
5. Enjoy your sorted Skittles!
